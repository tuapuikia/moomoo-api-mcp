## Installation

### Quick Start (Recommended)

You can run the server directly using `uvx` (part of the [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) toolkit).
Using `--refresh` ensures you are always running the latest version:

```bash
uvx --refresh moomoo-api-mcp
```

### Permanent Installation

To install it as a persistent tool available in your shell:

```bash
uv tool install moomoo-api-mcp
# Then run:
moomoo-api-mcp
```

> **Note**: The `moomoo-api` Python SDK and other dependencies will be installed automatically.

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Litash/moomoo-api-mcp.git
   cd moomoo-api-mcp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Run locally**:
   ```bash
   uv run moomoo-api-mcp
   ```

## Configuration

### 1. Prerequisites

#### Moomoo OpenD (Required)

The MCP server communicates with the Moomoo API via **Moomoo OpenD**, a local gateway application. You **MUST** install and run this first.

1. **Download OpenD**:
   - Visit the [Moomoo Open API Download Page](https://www.moomoo.com/download/opend).
   - Download the version appropriate for your OS (Windows/Mac/Linux).

2. **Install & Run**:
   - Install the application.
   - Launch **Moomoo OpenD**.
   - Log in with your Moomoo account credentials.

3. **Configure**:
   - Ensure the listening port is set to `11111` (this is the default).
   - **Note**: The MCP server connects to `127.0.0.1:11111` by default.

### 2. Environment Variables

To enable **REAL account** access, you must securely provide your credentials.

| Variable                | Description                                | Example  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| `MOOMOO_TRADE_PASSWORD` | Your trading password (plain text)         | `123456` |
| `MOOMOO_SECURITY_FIRM`  | Your broker region (e.g., FUTUSG, FUTUINC) | `FUTUSG` |
| `MOOMOO_DAILY_LIMIT`    | Daily budget limit (multi-currency)        | `1000USD,500SGD` |
| `MOOMOO_DAILY_LOSS`     | Daily realized loss limit (multi-currency) | `200USD` |
| `GLOBAL_LIMIT`          | Persistent global budget (multi-currency)  | `5000USD` |

> **Note**: Without these, the server runs in **SIMULATE-only mode** (paper trading).

### 3. Persistent Risk Management

This server includes advanced safety mechanisms using a local SQLite database to prevent automated agents from over-trading.

- **Unified Persistence**: All limits and inventory are stored in `moomoo_risk.db`, surviving server restarts.
- **Limit Types**:
    - **Global Limit**: A persistent total budget that only replenishes when the agent sells positions at a profit or break-even.
    - **Daily Limit**: Resets every calendar day (UTC). Tracks total buy volume.
    - **Daily Loss**: Resets every calendar day (UTC). Tracks total realized realized loss.
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Define limits for multiple currencies simultaneously (e.g., `1000USD,500SGD`).
- **Inventory Isolation**: The agent only tracks and manages stocks it has purchased. It will **not** sell your existing "Human" positions.
- **Auto-Stop**: The agent is blocked from placing new **BUY** orders once ANY limit is hit.
- **Audit Trail**: Every limit change and trade is logged in the database for full transparency.

### 3. Configure Claude Desktop

Add the server to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

#### Option A: Using PyPI Package (Recommended)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "moomoo": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--refresh", "moomoo-api-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MOOMOO_TRADE_PASSWORD": "your_trading_password",
        "MOOMOO_SECURITY_FIRM": "FUTUSG"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: The `--refresh` flag ensures you always have the latest version but may increase startup time due to version checking. You can remove it once you have the correct version installed.

#### Option B: Local Development

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "moomoo": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "C:\\path\\to\\moomoo-api-mcp",
        "run",
        "moomoo-api-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MOOMOO_TRADE_PASSWORD": "your_trading_password",
        "MOOMOO_SECURITY_FIRM": "FUTUSG"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Security**: Never commit your password to version control. The `env` block in the config file remains local.

## AI Agent Guidance

> **IMPORTANT**: All account tools default to **REAL** trading accounts.

When using this MCP server, AI agents **MUST**:

1. **Notify the user clearly** before accessing REAL account data. Example:

   > "I'm about to access your **REAL trading account**. This will show your actual portfolio and balances."

2. **Follow the unlock workflow** for REAL accounts:
   - First call `unlock_trade` (it handles env vars automatically, or pass password if needed).
   - Then call account/trading tools (they default to `trd_env='REAL'`).

3. **Only use SIMULATE accounts when explicitly requested** by the user. To use simulation:
   - Pass `trd_env='SIMULATE'` parameter explicitly.
   - No unlock is required for simulation accounts.

### Workflow Example

```text
User: "Show me my portfolio"

Agent Response:
"I'm accessing your REAL trading account to show your portfolio.
If you prefer to use a simulation account instead, please let me know."

[Proceeds to unlock_trade → get_account_summary]
```

### Order Status Filter Usage

When using `get_orders` or `get_history_orders`, the `status_filter_list` parameter accepts an array of **string values**:

```json
["SUBMITTED", "FILLED_ALL", "CANCELLED_ALL"]
```

**Valid status strings:**

- `UNSUBMITTED`, `WAITING_SUBMIT`, `SUBMITTING`, `SUBMIT_FAILED`
- `SUBMITTED`, `FILLED_PART`, `FILLED_ALL`
- `CANCELLING_PART`, `CANCELLING_ALL`, `CANCELLED_PART`, `CANCELLED_ALL`
- `REJECTED`, `DISABLED`, `DELETED`, `FAILED`, `NONE`

> **Note**: The server automatically converts these strings to the required SDK enum format. If no orders match the filter, an empty list is returned.
